# RegistrationPage
this repository is a small Registration Page that I developed to train my notions in JS and especially Object Orientation.

The project has a class called Employee, and this class has general properties. From it, three subclasses are generated, which inherit the properties and add new ones. These new properties vary by subclass. The registers are generated from instances of these subclasses.
